I am currently a second-year student pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics at UC San Diego. I am originally from Busan, South Korea, but also lived in diverse cities such as Tokyo and Atlanta before settling in San Diego.
 
With a keen interest in understanding the complex genomic and proteomic data through sequencing technology, I am dedicated to explore innovative solutions that enhance our ability to tailor medical treatments to individual patients.
