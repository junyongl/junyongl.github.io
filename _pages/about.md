**ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Junyong Lee!**\
I am currently a second-year student pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics at UC San Diego. I am originally from Busan, South Korea, but also lived in diverse cities such as Tokyo and Atlanta before settling in San Diego.
 
With a keen interest in understanding the complex genomic and proteomic data through sequencing technology, I am dedicated to explore innovative solutions that enhance our ability to tailor medical treatments to individual patients. 

**ðŸ§¬ Why Bioinformatics?**\
I was first introduced to bioinformatics when I was in high school, during my biology class. With thousands of health disorders caused by genetic mutations, and millions of people losing their lives because of these diseases, I became convinced that understanding the human genome is the most crucial step for the enhancement of healthcare. By integrating computational analysis with complex genetic data, bioinformatics enables researchers to uncover and analyze the intricate genetic patterns for the application of appropriate treatment for different patients. Through bioinformatics, I believe we can unravel the complex genetic variations underlying diseases, paving the way for more precise and efficient clinical treatment, ultimately advancing healthcare. 

**ðŸ§ª Research Interests**\
I am interested in analyzing genetic data to identify the genetic factors underlying disorders, and implementing personalized medicine to deliver treatments that are more precise and effective.

**ðŸ”¬ Ongoing Project**\
I am currently working on a bioinformatics project aimed at predicting cancer occurrence through an artificial intelligence model based on a patientsâ€™ genetic data. My research explores the role of genetic mutations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), in cancer development. Utilizing data from over 2 million cancer patients from TCGA, I have structued a DataFrame for optimal one-hot encoding and deep learning process via Pandas.
