I am currently a second-year student pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics at UC San Diego. I am originally from Busan, South Korea, but also lived in diverse cities such as Tokyo and Atlanta before settling in San Diego.
 
With a keen interest in understanding the complex genomic and proteomic data through sequencing technology, I am dedicated to explore innovative solutions that enhance our ability to tailor medical treatments to individual patients. 

<Why Bioinformatics?>

<Research Interests>

<Ongoing Project>
I'm currently working on a bioinformatics project aimed at predicting cancer occurrence through an artificial intelligence model based on a patients’ genetic data. My research explores the role of genetic mutations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), in cancer development. Utilizing data from over 2 million cancer patients from TCGA, I have structued a DataFrame for optimal one-hot encoding and deep learning process via Pandas.
