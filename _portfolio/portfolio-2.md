A personal research on producing a biodiesel from canola oil and methanol through transesterification process. 

My main focus for this research was to explore the infleunce of concentration of methanol on combustion energy of the biodiesel and the amount of waster glycerol produced. 

The fuel efficiency of biodiesel was highest when the concentration of the methanol was 100% (purest) as it produced heat energy of 10.9 kJ/g. The combustion energy of the biodiesel was increased by approxiamtely 30%.
