A personal research on creating a mathematical model to compare and explore the difference between an amateur (myself) and professional basketball player (Damian Lillard). 

My main focus for this research was to mathematically represent the the upper and lower body movement mathematically and see how my movement is different to that of a professional athlete. I used a software called Tracker to create a trignometric function for the hand and knee movement during shooting, and utilized trignometirc R method and root mean square error (RMSE) to compare the movements. 

Comparing my hand and knee movement to that of a professional player, my hand movement showed a higher RMSE value (0.696) compared to the knee movement (0.179). This shows that there is a relatively bigger discrepancy between my hand movement and that of a professional athlete which is the reason for lower shooting percentage.
