A personal research on exploring the optimum condition for *S. cerevisiae*â€™s anaerobic respiration rate and its ethanol tolerance. 

My main focus for this research was to study how the fermentation rate of *S. cerevisiae* will change based on different concentration of fructose solutions. I also focused on how much ethanol was produced as a byproduct of the anaerobic respiration and how this will influence the fermentation rate of the *S. cerevisiae*.  

The fermentation rate was the highest when the concentration of the fructose solution was 150 g/dm<sup>3</sup>. The average fermentation rate of the *S. cerevisiae* was approximately 5155 ppm/min and started decrease as the concentration of solution increased further. The maximum ethanol concentration in which *S. cerevisiae* could tolerate was approximately 21.7% v/v.
