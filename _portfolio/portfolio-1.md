As a bioengineer presenting poster is crucial as it provides excellent practice in explaining quickly and clearly why my project is important and what my findings mean. 

For this introductory biology lab course, my group designed an experiment for a project on the analysis of **EMG data** to analyze the influence of different types of **caffeine** on **muscle reaction time**.

Our experimental design via verbal presentation to the professors and teaching assistants.

*Below is link to my thesis poster.*
